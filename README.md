## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JS animate method
- Cursor follower
- Desktop-first workflow
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor

### What I learned

I've had some/many problems with making the events on image click but in the end, I guess I managed. I also wanted to have a try with mouse follower for the first time as it seemed to me that the vibe od the website suits it.

```js
enlarged.animate([
  {
    transform: 'translateY(-150px)',
    opacity: 0
  },
  {
    transform: 'translateY(0)',
    opacity: 1
  }
], animateParams)
```
